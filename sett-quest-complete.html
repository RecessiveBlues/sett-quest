            <h3>Key SETT Model Principles</h3>
            <p>Remember that effective assistive technology solutions require a comprehensive analysis of all four SETT components and how they interconnect. The most successful recommendations consider the student's strengths and challenges, the demands of their environment, the specific tasks they need to complete, and the tools that best bridge the gaps.</p>

            <h2>Key SETT Model Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student:</strong> Consider the whole student - strengths, challenges, interests, and preferences. Go beyond focusing on just the disability.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Analyze all settings where the student needs to function, not just a single location. Technology should work across all relevant environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Break down specific task demands to understand exactly where barriers exist. Different tasks may require different accommodations.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Select technologies that address the specific needs identified in your analysis. The right tool bridges the gap between student abilities and task demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> The most effective solutions consider how all four components interconnect. No single component should be evaluated in isolation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>By applying the SETT model systematically, you can make more effective assistive technology recommendations that truly meet students' needs in all contexts.</p>
